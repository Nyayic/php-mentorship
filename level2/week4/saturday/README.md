# CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS
## CONSTRUCTOR
- In PHP, constructors are special methods that are automatically called when an object of a class is created. 
- Constructors are used to initialize the properties of an object with default values or user-defined values.
- To create a constructor in PHP, you need to define a method with the same name as the class.
